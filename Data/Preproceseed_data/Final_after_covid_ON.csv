392,car safety is actually a great public safety comparison i think ive heard putting your kid in a car carries risk too yes it does which is why we have so many rules in place to prevent crashes injuries and deaths so many lets review,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-12,18:13:33
393,does it sound reasonable to say we should drop all of our efforts to prevent motor vehicle injuries and deaths no it doesnt we put a lot of effort into highway safety because the social contract has always been that above all else we have a right to safety,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-12,18:13:38
394,contrast these numbers car crashes vs covidall of the above effort is for deaths in a year less than a day and serious injuriesin the first days of covid killed people in quebec  a day and put people in the hospital over in icu,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-12,18:13:38
395,the logic is off without the highway safety code the number of motor vehicle injuries and deaths would be worse we do all of this to keep those numbers as low as we can and were never satisfied we keep adding mitigations to improve the numbers,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-12,18:13:38

400,why are caseshospitdeaths picking up again in denmark but not the uk i dont know but its interesting that based on google mobility theyve actually changed their behavior in denmark and not in the uk one could argue that theyre doing worse bc they trust their government,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-14,04:00:33
401,the google translate of your report says this in the th paragraph however the death toll is still useful in assessing mortality because the majority still die of covid is this a correct translation,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-14,13:38:58

415,with deaths in january  and an ifr that should be around as high as even but was used for the provinces estimate of million total so lets go with that the true number of cases would be in the ballpark million is impossible and incorrect,lisa_iannattone,2022-02-23,17:18:41

431,ive read it and it says that you dont know because the  figure you cite is a mathematical estimation and isnt based on looking at death certificates it was also interesting to learn that reinfection deaths and delayed deaths are not counted in the death toll,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-01,13:02:54
432,the minimal overcounting of deaths in which covid was not a contributing factor at all is balanced by the undercounting of delayedreinfection deaths which is why deaths within days of a positive result has been a standard way of reporting deaths as your report mentions,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-01,13:05:52
433,that doesnt answer my question which was for how many of the other  where covid was not the immediate cause of death was covid considered to have contributed to the death,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-01,13:45:44

451,he should clarify who hes counting as with covid i wonder if hes counting the deaths where covid was not the immediate cause of death but still listed as a contributing cause of death as with covid even though a positive test would not have been incidental in those cases,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-11,12:55:31
452,thanks yes i suspect thats how hes counting them up until now having the death toll include deaths with covid as either the main cause or a contributing cause have lined up well with our excess deaths in quebec so i wouldnt call them incidental either,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-11,14:06:27

457,how else do you explain the claim that  of our covid deaths didnt die of covid when dying of covid as either the primary or secondary cause of death is the definition of how qc counts covid deaths how would we be overcounting by that much with the criteria were using,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-12,03:46:08

488,we actually dont get to personal choice many of our safety decisions theres nothing new there whats new is the apathy to mass death disability and a tanking healthcare system whats new is turning a public health and safety issue into a polarizing political issue,lisa_iannattone,2022-03-27,01:50:19

499,the s were a bad time for influenza setting a vaccination target of  for   of  brought mortality down to the levels we have now yr  with covid weve vaccinated  of  and nearly  of  and we still had deaths in months with masks,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-03,12:10:56
500,no mention of the fact that  of  year olds are vaccinated and nearly  of  and we still had x the average of annual influenza deaths in the last months with masks lets use immunizations we have theres almost no one left to vaccinate its not enough,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-03,13:00:36

502,the surge in cases in canada will translate into a surge in hospitalizations and then deaths thats how this works weve been through it times already twice with a highly vaccinated pop how can anyone seriously try to play the we dont know yet card on round six we know,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-03,15:10:13

509,yes theyre opening up now and are acquainting themselves with waves of covid hospitalizations and deaths but theres this ridiculous rhetoric out there that it was all for nothing feels like some people just cant handle being this wrong and are trying to rewrite history,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-08,00:59:30
510,a world without covid is the best case scenario hopefully we get a second chance at it at some point for now through id settle for a world we at least acknowledge covid as one of our leading causes of death and disability and do something about it anything start anywhere,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-08,04:01:10
511,governments everywhere are now forcing the vulnerable to take their chances with death because testing and data make people too cautious for their liking some of their voters dont like masks and ventilationfiltration is too expensive when did we collectively consent to this,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-08,12:47:31
512,a friend in mauritius told me they read the names of all the people that died each day on the radio when announcing the number of deaths that day such a contrast to our approach in the west we need more reminders that the statistics are human beings not less,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-10,16:44:47
513,some of those people will end up in the hospital or dead its the truth the cdc made this point very elegantly back in by contact tracing a party where people caught covid it led to multiple secondary outbreaks one in an ltc and deaths of people that werent there,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-10,22:46:13

515,depression is also a brain disease which is why we work so hard to destigmatize it and treat people suffering with it i have no problem using postcovid brain disease instead of damage my point is that brain fog is a symptom and doesnt capture the disease process,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-11,16:55:46
516,brain disease brain damage brain inflammation acutechronic brain injury brain failure take your pick the exact term doesnt matter as much as having a term that people can understand as meaning the brain is altered by a covid infection with objective losses in function,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-11,17:43:59
517,again making my point for me we dont have the capacity to actually document the objective loss of cognitive function for most people but thats a very poor reason to then assume that what most people experience is subjective and not objective,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-11,17:47:55
518,what if the psychological distress is caused by the cognitive dysfunction and not the other way around though just because depression causes cognitive dysfunction doesnt mean that thats the order of things in postviral cognitive syndromes too,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-11,20:03:35

522,to date deaths are  higher in than in  surpassing s death toll in the next few weeks is now a mathematical certainty depending how the second months of play out we may have significantly more deaths in than in when all is said and done,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-13,12:10:33

528,cm demonstrated that chemoio enables less extensive surgery without compromising r resection rate presumably chemoio could also enable less extensive rt fields its a shame though that port data is associated with such a high rate of cardiopulmonary death,DoctorJSpicer,2022-04-14,00:23:35
529,the international covid excess mortality collaborators recent paper in the lancet also confirmed taras groups findings bcs excess mortality is more than double their official covid death toll and is on par with albertas the jig is up,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-14,02:34:57
530,they keep trying to attribute the massive excess death toll to an increase in opioid deaths but whenever anyone looks at the data that hypothesis falls apart tara also took great care to factor in excess opioid deaths its still mostly uncounted covid,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-14,11:25:57
531,and like you said all of these crises pandemic opioid crisis climate catastrophe are public healths job to manage so whatever the proportion attributable to each crisis the fact remains that bc is doing extremely poorly in terms of excess deaths from ph issues,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-14,11:32:05
532,smallpox has a history lesson for us it killed  londoners for gt years until vaccinationeradication if the population is no longer naive and covid is still killing at a rate that makes it the rd leading cause of death this is what covid endemia looks like deadly,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-14,13:22:12
533,yup the death count gives them away even in jurisdictions that manage to manipulate their covid death toll it eventually catches up to them cant hide excess mortality data forever although manitoba canada certainly seems determined to try,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-14,17:16:46
534,hows it going in quebec in view flirting with level surge capacity a  increase in icu admissions in the last hours and being on track to surpass s death toll for the whole year in the first months of means everything is under control,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-15,00:39:38

538,the west shunned elimination in on a gamble that one of things would happen covid would be easy to keep under control andor a vaccine would effectively end the pandemic andor covid would eventually be a seasonal virus similar to influenza we lost the bet,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-15,14:13:02

542,allowing the unmitigated explosive circulation of a transmissible pathogen that even after achieving vaccination targets of gt of the population is still the leading cause of death in the west that is a neverbeforeseen public health policy that deserves some snark,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-16,03:06:52

550,by making these kinds of adaptations not only can we lessen the continuing burden of covid we can also decrease other respiratory infections including the average hospital admissions and deaths from influenza each year,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-19,02:16:10
551,however to truly adapt our society we need provincial and federal leadership through two difficult years canada has had fewer than half as many per capita deaths as the united kingdom and per cent fewer than the united statesyet were suddenly following their lead,lisa_iannattone,2022-04-19,02:16:11
