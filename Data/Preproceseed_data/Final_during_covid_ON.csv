636,a truly sad collection of cries for help from around the world to just acknowledge airborne transmission and protect hcws essential workers and the public with airborne precautions it shouldnt be so controversial to protect your citizens,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-07,19:58:10
637,if the basis of a successful pandemic response is to test trace isolate and support how can closing our eyes to all these cases lead to anything other than a loss of control over the situation,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-07,21:07:47
638,maureen ambersley was a caring nurse mother sister amp grandmothershe died because policies werent implemented in to prevent health worker deaths from please consider supporting her legacy by donating at the link below,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-07,22:37:41
639,this is a humanitarian disastereven worse the number of deaths doesnt reflect the people who werent provided food amp water or basic care it doesnt reflect the emotional trauma amp anguish of the familieshow could the government call ever this home stable,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-07,23:45:20

643,in ontario major depression is the most common mental illness see what quality care looks like,OntarioHealthOH,2021-01-08,15:05:08
644,the problem is that the ministry only released a guidance document amp left all the power in the hands of the ltc homes themselves sadly there are many places where family caregivers and residents still face these inhumane restrictions,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-09,14:55:11
645,undoubtedly this was a terrible error which is causing vaccine preventable deaths they need to vaccinate ltc residents health workers amp family caregivers as soon as possible across all regions of ontario,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-09,20:56:39
646,i just answered this above on an individual level your risk of a bad outcome is the same however your risk of actually catching it is now much higher and on a population level a more transmissible strain leads to more deaths than a deadlier one,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-10,00:40:06

659, support families during isolation financially but also with safe locations for vulnerable family members to isolate many live in households where its impossible to physically isolate family members from each other cancel standardized testing kids are stressed enough,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,03:53:21
660,we missed the opportunity to move quickly and get ahead of the original threat a year later were still paying for it in lives loss of health economic hardship isolation mental health disease schooling uncertainty were paying for it by having to face this new threat,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,04:09:01
661,they would definitely blame fomites in canada shes a cleaner definitely fomites and then also just gloss right over the uk strain and not talk about it other than to say the cases were linked to travel and not of concern,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,05:27:40
662,well never agree bc as important as schools are itll never be as important as healthy living parents amp grandparents schools have been open since sept kids are still in crisis the pandemic is the problem anxiety illness death loss of normalcy and financial insecurity,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,16:02:51
663,we clearly have a fundamentally different opinion on the impact of preventable loss of life and health and how much risk were willing to accept when peoples lives and health are at stake everything is temporary except death even zoom school,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,16:04:46
664,and my position isnt to close schools indefinitely just until we can make them safe  weeks of zoom school in the big picture isnt more damaging than the impact of an uncontrolled pandemic stress at home sickdead relatives and financial insecurity,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,16:07:42
665,today ontario reached the horrendous milestone of deaths in as we grieve we should also reflect about arbitrary numbers like number who was a real person like us and experienced emotions like love amp happiness and that their death was preventable,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-13,18:19:15
666,yes the covid provinces have checked out and just want to keep as much open as they can while calling it a lockdown in hopes of being able to cruise right through this next part bc they have a few vaccines the threat of b and v are just glossed over,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-13,21:10:48
667,oh this makes me sad a wonderful hospital where patients are no longer safe most of their covid patients caught it at the hospital because its airborne  why isnt a situation like this being treated like an emergency get engineers in there give hcws appropriate ppe,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,00:20:24
668,i am so incredibly sorry for your loss,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-14,13:32:13
669,some background on the great barrington declaration gbd proposes a focused approach to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection while better protecting those who are at highest risk,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,14:44:28
670,manaus is the city of gbd dreams a city of million like montreal with a very young population at minimal risk of death  younger than  that stopped believing in covid sometime last spring in a population this young the infection fatality rate is only about ,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,14:44:32
671,ive tweeted before about being wary of small percentages with covid covid lives in a world of large numbers and small percentages are deceiving the first wave brought utter devastation to this city with over deaths this is where they buried the bodies,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,14:44:33
672,but even mass graves of young citizens wont sway the gbders though theyd never say it they see this as sad but inevitable because after the carnage  of people in manaus were immune and the holy grail of herd immunity through infection was achieved and they could move on,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,14:44:33
673,and as usual the gbd crowd with their belief system that has absolutely no basis in fact or science would be wrong manaus has declared a state of emergency amid an onslaught of new hospitalisations and deaths,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,14:44:35
674,in ontario major depression is the most common mental illness see what quality care looks like,OntarioHealthOH,2021-01-14,16:21:00
675,so to summarize allowing those at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity through natural infection leads mass graves of young healthy citizens and still no herd immunity this approach is unethical and misguided,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,16:35:30
676,as a physician with a loved one in a long term care home in that is currently on outbreak this is very distressed and disappointing news,RyanDaveyMD,2021-01-14,17:43:53
677,its clearly an easy fall from balancing measures schools vs restaurants to balancing deaths paying with lives to keep parents in the workforce during the peak of the pandemic its clear that mitigation was misguided and the only approach to covid is aggressive suppression,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-14,22:43:54
678,very sad but not surprising at allim still wondering though as to why frontline health workers have to act as whistleblowers in the first place when all ltc homes should be required to be fully honest and transparent about staffing levels why isnt this happening,AmitAryaMD,2021-01-15,00:50:08
679,anyone who has any oxygen available please bring it to the clinic near the airport there are so many people dying for the love of godin the coming hours manaus is going to be the protagonist of one of the saddest chapters of the covid epidemic in the world,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-15,01:32:53

688,thats reassuring still the worst death rate in canada though,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-16,03:32:15
689,these are life and death decisions for many quebecers particularly in the cmm i would think the very minimum would be to wait for the data on more contagious variants before making a decision that could drastically change our trajectory for the worse,lisa_iannattone,2021-01-16,16:20:26
