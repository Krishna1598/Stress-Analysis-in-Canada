## Description
This research aims to examine the levels of stress experienced by healthcare workers during the pandemic by analyzing their Twitter activity in two major Canadian provinces, British Columbia and Ontario. This study utilizes both quantitative and qualitative analysis of Twitter data to investigate the mental wellness of healthcare workers in Canada _before, during, and after_ the COVID-19 pandemic. The study employs topic modeling technique and large language models, to analyze tweets and categorize them into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, each with a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1. The results are visualized in the form of graphs to facilitate interpretation. The analysis reveals that negative sentiments have increased significantly during and after the pandemic, with sadness, anger, and fear being the dominant negative emotions and remain elevated in both provinces, with a higher peak observed in Ontario.
